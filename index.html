    <p>I am an ambitious and dedicated Middle schooler with a passion for learning and interest in web development. My curiosity led me to explore the basics of HTML, and i even tried my hand at creating simple web pages and interactive features.While I enjoy working on indivisual projects, I also appreciate the value of team work, which i experience on a daily basis in school group projects and activities.</p>
